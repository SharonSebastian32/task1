        Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer
        systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human
        intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, learning, reasoning,
        language understanding, and visual perception. AI encompasses various
        subfields, such as machine learning, natural language processing,
        computer vision, and robotics. With advancements in algorithms and
        computational power, AI has become integral to industries like
        healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, offering solutions such as
        predictive analytics, personalized recommendations, and automation. AI
        can be categorized into narrow AI, which specializes in specific tasks,
        and general AI, which aims to replicate human cognitive abilities. While
        narrow AI is already widely implemented, general AI remains a
        theoretical goal. The rapid evolution of AI is transforming business
        processes, enhancing decision-making, and driving innovations across
        many sectors, though it also raises ethical concerns about privacy, job
        displacement, and decision transparency. As AI continues to evolve, its
        potential to shape the future of technology and society is immense.

        Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that
        focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to
        learn from and make decisions based on data. It involves the use of
        statistical techniques to give computers the ability to identify
        patterns, make predictions, and improve performance without explicit
        programming. Machine learning models are trained on large datasets and
        can perform tasks like image recognition, natural language processing,
        and recommendation systems. Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement
        learning are the primary types of machine learning, each suited to
        different types of problems. Supervised learning uses labeled data to
        train models, while unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to
        discover hidden patterns. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand,
        focuses on decision-making in environments by maximizing cumulative
        rewards. As machine learning technology evolves, it is becoming
        increasingly integral to industries such as healthcare, finance, and
        autonomous systems, enabling smarter, more efficient solutions. Its
        growing impact on automation, personalization, and predictive analytics
        is reshaping the future of technology.
